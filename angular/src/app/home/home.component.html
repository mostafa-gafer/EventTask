            Task Description Learn how to create and run a complete Event Registration Web
            Application using the ABP Framework's application startup template. This task guides you
            through building a fully functional system that allows administrators to manage events
            and users to register for them, following DDD best practices, RBAC, and localization
            standards. You will implement: An Event Management Module where admins can create,
            update, activate/deactivate, and delete their own events. A User Registration System
            where users can browse active events, register, cancel registration (up to 1 hour before
            start time), and view their own events. Capacity control, online/offline logic, and
            ownership restrictions (admins may manage only events they created). Notifications &
            validations such as preventing registration when capacity is full. Arabic and English
            localization for both backend and Angular frontend. A fully layered solution following
            Domain Driven Design (DDD) patterns. By completing this task, you will learn how to: Use
            ABP's predefined architecture to build modular, scalable solutions. Implement entities,
            domain services, and application services using DDD. Apply authorization rules using ABP
            Permissions. Build Angular UI pages for event CRUD operations and user registration
            flows. Configure EF Core, database migrations, and seeding with ABP. Localize the entire
            application (backend + frontend).
